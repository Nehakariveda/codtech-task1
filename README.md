Overview: Version Control with Git in DevOps

Version control is a critical component of the DevOps workflow, enabling teams to collaborate efficiently, track changes, and ensure code stability. Git, a distributed version control system, is the most widely used tool for managing source code in DevOps pipelines.

Why Git in DevOps?

Collaboration & Workflow: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, with branching and merging strategies to manage changes effectively.

CI/CD Integration: Git is seamlessly integrated with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools, automating code testing, builds, and deployments.

Change Tracking & Rollbacks: Every code modification is recorded, allowing easy tracking of changes and the ability to revert to previous versions if needed.

Code Quality & Security: Pull requests, code reviews, and access controls help maintain high code quality and security.

Scalability & Efficiency: Gitâ€™s distributed nature ensures that developers can work offline and sync changes when ready, making it suitable for both small and large-scale projects.


Key Git Features in DevOps

Branching & Merging: Developers work in isolated branches, merge updates, and resolve conflicts efficiently.

Commit History: A detailed log of changes helps in auditing and debugging.

Git Hooks: Automate pre- and post-commit actions to enforce coding standards and trigger CI/CD pipelines.

Tagging & Releases: Create stable releases with version tags for structured deployments.

Integration with DevOps Tools: Git seamlessly integrates with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
